# THE AUTO WALLET

#INTRODUCTION

The WALLET project, named Auto Wallet, is the project I've picked. When the user used to save the information of their CAR Â in this WALLET, they could compute the EMI of the CAR. This can be applied in warehouse storage management, where you can enter each car's information and see the number of cars that have been stored in the warehouse management.
This project includes three phases: one on the management side (warehouse entry), one on the user side (where they can calculate EMI monthly and list their car), and one on the buyer side (where they can view a list of available cars and their specifications, as well as calculate their EMI.
